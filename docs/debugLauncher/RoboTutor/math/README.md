This is the Custom Math Skill Debug Launcher folder.

Define the custom launchers required to debug manually generated datasources that are maintained in the associated tutors subfolder for the tutor variant used.

Place a single button_data.json with description of the custom debug launcher buttons.

Each button defined within the button_data.json should have an associated tutor folder with the following stucture. Note that there should be matching tutor datasources for all languages to permit debugging.

<tutorfolder>
	<en>
		<named datasource.json>
	<sw>
